sMETASeq
This tutorial shows how to run sMETASeq using Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/)

## Purpose :

sMETASeq is an analysis pipeline to detect microbes, including virus, bacteria and other pathogens, from small RNA-seq data. The pipeline will also include steps to generate host small RNA expression profiles. The microbes are detected using the kraken database and the host small RNAs are detected using miRBase and RNACentral, for miRNAs and other small RNAs, respectively.
